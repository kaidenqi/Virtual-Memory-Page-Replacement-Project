Lab 4   

Write a program to compare the performance of the LRU and the Optimal page replacement 
algorithms. The program will take a reference string and the number of frames as inputs.  
Assume the maximum length of a reference string is 20 and there are 5 diffent pages from 
page 1 to page 5. The reference string can be randomly generated and the number of frames 
is entered through the keyboard. For example, the system generates a reference string 
2 1 3 4 5 2 3 ...5 and you enter the number of frames 3. Compare the number of page 
faults generated by the Optimal and LRU algorithms. Print out the page replacement process 
and you can see how LRU differs from the optimal.  

Submission:

In order not to lose any files, you'd better zip all your files into a .zip file. 

Submit your project to TRACS before the deadline. Homework will NOT be accepted 
through emails. You should write a readme textfile telling the grader how to run 
your programs. Without this file, it is very likely that your project will not be 
run properly.
